"""
This script reads a CSV file containing a list of URLs and their connections, and creates a network graph
showing the connections between the links.

The CSV file should have the following structure:
    - Column 1: Source URL
    - Column 2: Target URL

The network graph will be saved as a PNG file.

Make sure to install the required libraries: networkx and matplotlib.
